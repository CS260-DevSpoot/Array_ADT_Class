# Array ADT Assignment

Your goal is to implement each of the methods in `Barray`
to get all of the tests to pass.

You can build the code and run the tests from the command line (e.g., in
Visual Studio Code) with: `dotnet test`. When a test fails, you can read the
test code that failed in `ArrayTest/UnitTest1.cs`. You must not modify any of the code in there.

There is a demonstration program in `AdtConsole` that you can edit and
change if you want to play around with the `Barray` class. You don't need to
do this - it's just a possible helper, especially if you want to run the
debugger on code other than the unit test. To run it: `dotnet run  --project AdtConsole`.
